### Web Scraping Books.toscrape.com 📚

This project demonstrates a simple web scraping script written in Python. It's designed to extract book information from the `books.toscrape.com` website, which is a great site for practicing web scraping.

The script uses the **`requests`** library to send an HTTP request to the website and the **`BeautifulSoup`** library to parse the HTML content.

### Key Features ✨

* **Data Extraction**: The script iterates through 50 pages of the website to collect data for a total of 1000 books.
* **Information Scraped**: It extracts the following details for each book:
    * **Book Name** 📖
    * **Price** 💰
    * **Stock Availability** ✅
    * **Star Rating** ⭐
* **Data Structuring**: The collected data is stored in lists, which are then used to create a **Pandas DataFrame** for easy viewing and analysis.
* **Output**: The final DataFrame contains organized columns for each piece of information, as shown in the output of the `df.head()` command.
